Computer Science 2018\r\n###Certification in Entrepreneurship \r\n\r\n##Undergraduate research assistant, Purdue Advanced Optics Lab \r\nI am working with Prof. E.Bae (Senior Research Scientist) and his graduate students to develop an android app that can count and differentiate different shape of objects. Final results will be reported as a statistical term (mean diameter, histogram count, etc). Application of this project will be using the smartphone for object detection and counting and augmented reality applications.\r\n\r\n##Ganita , Android app\r\nGanita is an addicting puzzle game based on arithmetic. This is an endless game where you have to solve six arithmetic equations to proceed to next level. It has two variations, timed and untimed. Difficulty gradually increases as level progresses.

Tech Used - OpenCv (OCR Library), Tesseract (OCR Library) , Java, Android SDK.\r\n\r\n##Angel Hack Delhi 2015\r\nApolloX - We developed Context aware and wish-list  management app. This app enables you to prepare wish-list of items that you need to buy and if you happen to be closer to store that sells your items, app sends you a notification. Worked on fronted android. Tech Used - Java, Android SDK, MongoDB, Yelp Api, Node.js.\r\n\r\n##Hack Mizzou 2014\r\nBoilerRover - We made a wooden rover that could be controlled by leap motion and android device(with accelerometer).  We were team of seven people who were new to programming. We ended up working together, teaching each other and finally finishing up this idea to conclusion. We won 1st place for this hack. Tech Used - Java, C, Arduino, Leap motion, bluetooth, C#.\r\n##Other Hackathons\r\nBoiler make 2014, Wild Hacks 2014 \r\n\r\n##Other Projects\r\nImplementation of IRC Server in C.\r\nSafeWalk Android App, Client - Server interaction to match up two users on inputted information.  \r\n\r\n#Skills\r\nProficient - Java, Android Development.  Familiar - OpenCv, C, Git.\r\n\r\nProgramming Paradigms Familiarity - Functional and Object Oriented Programming.\r\n\r\n#Awards\r\nCS Endowment Scholarship for academic achievement 2015 \r\n\r\nDean of Students and Semester Honors 2015\r\n\r\n1st Place Hack Mizzou 2014\r\n\r\n#Clubs \r\nMathematics Club, Purdue Hackers, SigApp.  \r\n\r\n###Links\r\n[Github](https://github.com/ayushnvijay)\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ayushnvijay)\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](<https://linkedin.com/in/ayushnvijay>)\r\n\r\n###Authors and Contributors\r\nAyush Vijaywargi @ayushnvijay","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
